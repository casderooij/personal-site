Introtext: <p>I am a web developer working at the intersection of user experience, design and technology. Since 2018, I've been building solutions such as booking flows, data dashboards, micro sites, 3D animations, and much more.</p><p>I gain knowledge from working on professional projects as well as from personal experiments. The insights and experiences I gain from personal projects often flow back into my client-based work.</p><p>I find the web a beautiful, accessible canvas for telling stories, giving insights and providing tools. Lots of things can be build for the web, and I'm here to do just that!</p>
